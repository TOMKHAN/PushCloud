PushCloud
=========

Google driven application showing simple push notification mechanism.
Application is made for my graduate work (FOI - www.foi.hr). It is a showcase of what can a system do around GCM.

You have to adjust PushCloud settings to work for your server. Adjustments needed in:
	-db.php with your sql db name and login + google_api_key
	-change your_server.com with your server in CommonUtilities
	-google-play-services_lib folder in the same place as this project. Add as library.
	-Chech google developer for getting your GCM API + id numbers.
	-for homework, study the code and see if there is other adjustments.
	
Code is easy to read. There are some bugs proly (even though I tested the app thoroughly).
Can be upgraded to a much larger scale.
Sorry for any leftover code that I forgot.

Fork, branch and enjoy.
